</head>
<body>
<p class="instructions">Instructions</p>
<p class="instructions">The exam will be in class and will involve you building a single external style sheet.
<br />On exam day, you will place the css file you create into the Assignments folder. 
<br />The goal is to follow the instructions in the HTML document to create the look described.
<br />You will see a picture (or pictures) of the result.</p>
<p class="instructions">You may use <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp" class="w3schools">w3schools.com</a> while writing this exam</p>
<p class="instructions">You shouldn't need <a href="http://citweb.lethbridgecollege.ab.ca" class="citweb">CITweb</a>. I just put it here for a different style example.</p> 
<p class="instructions">This is what the page looks like with style: <a href="practice2.html">No CSS</a></p>
<hr class="hrule" />
<p class="notice">Notice the body color of all the pages is silver.<br />
Notice that this paragraph's font is 200% of normal.</p>
<h1>&lt;h1&gt;this text is red!&lt;/h1&gt;</h1>
<h2>&lt;h2&gt;this text is green; this background is orange&lt;/h2&gt;</h2>
<h2 class="trans">&lt;h2&nbsp;class="trans"&gt;text is green;background is transparent&lt;/h2&gt;</h2>
<h2 class="red">&lt;h2&nbsp;class="red"&gt;this text is red!&lt;/h2&gt;</h2>
<p>Look how <span class="overunder">this phrase</span> in a &lt;span&gt; has an over-line and and underline.</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is an unordered list</li>
	<li>The bullets load an image from the url "http://bit.ly/TRYrSg"</li>
	<li>This one was found on <a class="reference" href="http://ascending.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/why-open-source-rocks-and-the-music-industry-does-not/">http://ascending.wordpress.com</a>
		<ol>
			<li>I don't know where that person found it.</li>
			<li>This ordered list uses lower-case roman numerals</li>
			<li>And the link above changes background color when you mouse over it.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
